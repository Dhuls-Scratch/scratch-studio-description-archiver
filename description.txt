+++ Application Notes +++
[For Curators and Managers]

1) Any studio member is allowed to post a users' application in the Special Actions studio. Before posting, verify the applicant and application meets the requirements. If you are unsure, ask a Manager.

2) Users who apply will be placed in a 1 week-long "pending" window where their application can be discussed by current members.

3) A Curator and Manager objection counts as -1. If and only if a Manager explicitly specifies, they can object -2. Please indicate whether you are a Curator or Manager by writing [Curator] or [Manager] at the start of your comment when discussing an applicant.

4) If after one week, the number of objections is less than 4, and at least four members have given feedback, the user is invited. If the number of applications is greater than 4, the application is rejected. 

5) If an application does not receive feedback from at least four members of the studio by the time the week-long period ends, the pending window will be extended until that number is reached.

+++ Promotion Notes +++

1) Only a members of TFH can request someone to be promoted, and it cannot be themselves.

2) If you wish to promote someone from Curator to Manager, please make your own comment thread to discuss the user's promotion.

3) If you believe someone should be promoted, say "support" and explain. 

4) If you do not believe a user should be promoted, you have the option of saying "no support" on their application if you are a Manager, as long as you provide an explanation. This will deduct 1 point from their vote. If the vote count reaches -3 or two weeks have passed without the promotion being accepted, then it will be rejected, and the user cannot be re-suggested for at least two weeks.

5) Curators' votes are +0.5; Managers +/-1.

6) If a promotion request gets three votes, (not counting the user who suggested them) then the user is promoted by a manager!

+++ Special Action Notes +++

A "special action" is a change to The Forum Helpers studio, big or small.

1) Curators and Managers who believe a special action should be taken can make a new comment that shares their idea.

2) Only managers and curators can vote on special actions. The user who suggested the idea cannot vote on it. Curators have 0.5 votes; Managers 1.

3) The number of votes it will take to get a special action implemented should be decided by a manager. Each special action varies in its own ways, and should require different amounts of votes.

4) Managers, please decide on a reasonable amount of votes that a special action requires. Try to abide by three votes, but if it's a radical change like abolishing the grading system, for instance, that could require more votes.

5) If given the necessary amount of votes and 24 hours have passed, then the special action is taken! If the special action requires the description of the studio to change (or some other aspect only studio hosts can edit) then the current studio host must implement it.

6) Negative votes subtract from a proposition's total vote count. 

7) Proposals are automatically rejected if two weeks pass without receiving the necessary votes to be implemented. If a proposal reaches -3/3, it will automatically be rejected even if two weeks haven't passed.
