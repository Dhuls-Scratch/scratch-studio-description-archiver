+++ Special Action Notes +++

A "special action" is a change to The Forum Helpers studio, big or small.

1) Curators and Managers who believe a special action should be taken can make a new comment that shares their idea.

2) Only managers and curators can vote on special actions. The user who suggested the idea cannot vote on it. Curators have 0.5 votes; Managers 1.

3) The number of votes it will take to get a special action implemented should be decided by a manager. Each special action varies in its own ways, and should require different amounts of votes.

4) Managers, please decide on a reasonable amount of votes that a special action requires. Try to abide by three votes, but if it's a radical change like abolishing the grading system, for instance, that could require more votes.

5) If given the necessary amount of votes and 24 hours have passed, then the special action is taken! If the special action requires the description of the studio to change (or some other aspect only studio hosts can edit) then the current studio host must implement it.

6) Negative votes subtract from a proposition's total vote count. 

7) Proposals are automatically rejected if two weeks pass without receiving the necessary votes to be implemented. If a proposal reaches -3/3, it will automatically be rejected even if two weeks haven't passed.
