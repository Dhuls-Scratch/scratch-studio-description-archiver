+++ Studio Information +++

If you would like to join The Forum Helpers, please go to the main studio (linked above) and fill in the application form provided.

Alternatively, if we see that youâ€™re helpful on the forums, we may invite you!

This is the second iteration of The Forum Helpers Special Actions studio, created on 8/2/2021 by @xXRedTheCoderXx. To view the first Special Actions studio, visit https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/4210258/

+++ Application Notes +++

With the current application and grading system, users who apply will be placed in a week-long "pending" window. During this time, current Forum Helpers can discuss the applicant, and members can object to the person joining. If specified, managers can give two objections. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, an objection from a manager or curator counts as one single objection by default. If after one week, there are less than four objections, the user is invited. Four objections are required to reject someone. This system also applies for invitations.

If you are a curator, please write [Curator] at the start of your comment when discussing an applicant. If you are a manager, write [Manager].

Curators are free to post an application in this studio for discussion.

+++ Promotion Notes +++

1) Only a curator or manager of TFH can request someone to be promoted, and it cannot be themselves.

2) If you wish to promote someone from curator to manager, please make your own comment thread to discuss the user's promotion.

3) If you believe someone should be promoted, say "support" and explain. This will add one or half a point to their vote. 

4) If you do not believe a user should be promoted, you have the option of saying "no support" on their application if you are a manager, as long as you provide an explanation. This will deduct 1 point from their vote. If the vote count reaches -3 or two weeks have passed without the promotion being accepted, then it will be rejected, and the user cannot be re-suggested for at least two weeks.

5) Curators' votes are worth half a vote.

6) If a promotion request gets three votes, (not counting the user who suggested them) then the user is promoted by a manager!

+++ Special Action Notes +++

A "special action" is a change to The Forum Helpers studio, big or small.

1) Curators and managers who believe a special action should be taken can make a new comment that shares their idea.

2) Only managers and curators can vote on special actions, however, curators only have half a vote whereas managers have a full vote. The user who suggested the idea cannot vote on it.

3) The number of votes it will take to get a special action implemented should be decided by a manager. Each special action varies in its own ways, and should require different amounts of votes.

4) Managers, please decide on a reasonable amount of votes that a special action requires. Try to abide by three votes, but if it's a radical change like abolishing the grading system, for instance, that could require more votes.

5) If given the necessary amount of votes and 24 hours have passed, then the special action is taken! If the special action requires the description of the studio to change (or some other aspect only studio hosts can edit) then the current studio host must implement it.

6) Negative votes subtract from a proposition's total vote count. 

7) Proposals are automatically rejected if two weeks pass without receiving the necessary votes to be implemented.
