+++ Studio Information +++

If you would like to join The Forum Helpers, please go to the other studio (linked above) and fill in the application form provided.

Alternatively, if we see that youâ€™re being helpful on the forums, we may invite you!

This is the second iteration of The Forum Helpers Special Actions studio, created on 8/2/2021 by @xXRedTheCoderXx. To view the first Special Actions studio, created by @customhacker, visit https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/4210258/

+++ Application Notes +++

With the current application and grading system, users who apply will be placed in a week-long "Application Pending" window. During this time, current Forum Helpers can discuss the applicant, and members can object to the person joining. If a manager objects, it counts as up to two objections. If a curator objects, it counts as up to one objection. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, an objection from a manager or curator counts as one single objection by default. If after one week, there are less than four objections, then the user can be invited. Four objections are required for someone to be rejected.

If you are a curator, please write [Curator] at the start of your comment when discussing an applicant. If you are a manager, write [Manager].

The amount of objections an applicant has received will be put next to their name on the pending applicants list.

Curators are free to post an application in this studio for discussion.

+++ Promotion Notes +++

1) Only a curator or manager of TFH can request someone to be promoted, and it cannot be themselves.

2) If you wish to promote someone from curator to manager, please make your own comment thread to discuss the user's promotion.

3) If you believe someone should be promoted, say "support" and explain, if you are a manager. This will add one point to their vote. 

4) If you do not believe a user should be promoted, you have the option of saying "no support" and explain why, on their application if you are a manager. This will not deduct any points from their vote, however if three managers do not support or two weeks have passed without the promotion being accepted than it will be rejected and the user cannot be suggested to be promoted again for at least two weeks.

5) Curators cannot vote for promotions, but they can provide their opinions in a constructive manner.

6) If a promotion request gets three manager votes, (not counting the user who suggested them) then the user is promoted by another manager!

7) When suggesting someone to be promoted, make sure to add their name to the pending promotions list and include the comment ID.

+++ Special Action Notes +++

A "special action" is a change to The Forum Helpers studio, whether big or small.

1) Curators and managers who believe a special action should be taken can make a new comment that shares their idea.

2) Only managers and curators can vote on special actions, however curators only have half a vote whereas managers have a full vote. The user who suggested the idea cannot vote on it.

3) The number of votes it will take to get a special action implemented should be decided by a manager. Each special action varies in its own ways, and should require different amounts of votes.

4) Managers, please decide on a reasonable amount of votes that a special action requires. Try to abide by three votes, but if it's a radical change like abolishing the grading system, for instance, that could require more votes.

5) If given the necessary amount of votes, then a special action is taken! If the special action requires the description of the studio to change (or some other aspect only studio hosts can edit) then the current studio host must implement it.

6) Negative votes subtract from a proposition's total vote count.
